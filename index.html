    <h1>ranked songs in dominic fike's mixtape: 'Rocket'</h1>
    <p>1) Great Pretender</p>
    <p>This song's a mixture of singing and rapping. I like the tone of this one with the instrumentation.</p>
    <p>2) One Glass</p>
    <p>One of his slower songs, but I like the guitar. The whole song has a nostalgic sound to it.</p>
    <p>3) All Hands on Deck</p>
    <p>I like the first verse of this song a lot. It's also nice tribute to his son.</p>
    <p>4) Sandman</p>
    <p>Definetly a more upbeat song. The references he makes in this song is fun.</p>
    <p>5) Aftermath</p>
    <p>Pretty short song and is very lighthearted.</p>
