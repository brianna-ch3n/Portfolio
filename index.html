    <h1>ranked songs in dominic fike's mixtape: 'Rocket'</h1>
    <p>1) Great Pretender
        This song's a mixture of singing and rapping. I like the tone of this one with the instrumentation.
    2) One Glass
        One of his slower songs, but I like the guitar. The whole song has a nostalgic sound to it.
    3) All Hands on Deck
        I like the first verse of this song a lot. It's also nice tribute to his son.
    4) Sandman
        Definetly a more upbeat song. The references he makes in this song is fun.
    5) Aftermath</p>
        Pretty short song and is very lighthearted.
